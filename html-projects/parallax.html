                <h2>If Not For You</h2>
                <p> If not for you, I wouldn’t know
                    What true love really meant.<br>
                    I’d never feel this inner peace;
                    I couldn’t be content.  <p></p>     
                    If not for you, I’d never have
                    The pleasures of romance.<br>
                    I’d miss the bliss, the craziness,
                    Of love’s sweet, silly dance.<p></p>

                    I have to feel your tender touch;
                    I have to hear your voice;<br>
                    No other one could take your place;
                    You’re it; I have no choice.<p></p>

                    If not for you, I’d be adrift;
                    I don’t know what I’d do;<br>
                    I’d be searching for my other half,
                    Incomplete, if not for you.</p>

                    I realize my dreams and fantasies.

                <h2>Reasons Why</h2>
                <p> Our love is the long lasting kind;
                    We’ve been together quite awhile.<br>
                    I love you for so many things,
                    Your voice, your touch, your kiss, your smile. <p></p>

                    You accept me as I am;
                    I can relax and just be me.<br>
                    Even when my quirks come out,
                    You think they’re cute; you let me be.<p></p>

                    With you, there’s nothing to resist;
                    You’re irresistible to me.<br>
                    I’m drawn to you in total trust;
                    I give myself to you willingly.<p></p>

                    Your sweet devotion never fails;
                    You view me with a patient heart.<br>
                    You love me, dear, no matter what.
                    You’ve been that way right from the start.<p></p>
                    Those are just a few reasons why
                    I’ll always love you like I do.<br>
                    We’ll have a lifetime full of love,
                    And it will happen because of you.</p>

                <h2>All The Things I Love About You.</h2>
                <p>
                    I love you for the warm, sweet affection<br>
                    in your eyes whenever you look at me,<br>
                    and the special smile
                    you save only for me.<p></p>
                    I love that you always seek<br>
                    to have your body close to mine,<br>
                    reaching out to touch,
                    to hold my hand,<br>
                    to wrap your arms around me.<p></p>
                    I love how you show me you care
                    by looking for ways<br>
                    to make my life easier and more comfortable.<p></p>
                    I love that when I ask you to do things,<br>
                    you try to do them<br>
                    instead of thinking me demanding.<p></p>
                    I love that your favorite place is near me,<br>
                    that you’d rather be with me<br>
                    than anywhere else.<p></p>
                    I love you for more reasons<br>
                    than this page has space to write,<br>
                    so I’ll try to tell you and show you in person<br>
                    all the things I love about you.
